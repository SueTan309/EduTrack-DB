# EDUTRACK DB
---
### PROJECT OVERVIEW

The project focuses on designing and implementing a robust relational database system for ABC Education to streamline data management and enhance operational efficiency. This database will centralize and organize information related to students, courses, registrations, and financial transactions. Key functionalities include stored procedures to automate repetitive tasks, such as fee calculations and report generation, and triggers to automatically update student balances and other dependent data in real-time. The system aims to ensure data integrity, scalability, and performance. This solution will provide ABC Education with a reliable, efficient, and secure platform to support its growing data needs and operational demands.
